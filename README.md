D480 - Software Design and Quality Assurance - Software Design and Quality Assurance applies a QA focus to every phase of the software
development life cycle. This course investigates best practices for quality analysis, quality planning, and testing strategies as they pertain to the
everyday practice of software development. Students will come to understand how their work fits into the bigger picture: how QA, testing, and code-
writing practices interact within specific process models; the potential impact of new code on existing code or on other applications; the importance of
usability and the influence users have on the ultimate success of an application. Students will explore test plans, test cases, unit tests, integration
tests, regression tests, usability tests, and test and review tools.
